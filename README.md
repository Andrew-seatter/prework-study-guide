# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This a prework study guide for my time at UCSD. I built this project for the purpose of tracking my progress and as a reference to pull back any notes in the future. It solves the problem of keeping notes in multiple books and serves as an organizational tool, while displaying my ability to program. In this project I learned the roots of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
